Thumb + Pen Interaction on tablets, presented by Pfeuffer, Hinckley, Pahud and Buxton, is a novel interaction technique where pen and touch input is combined when the nonpreferred hand holds the tablet. They did a set of probes with distinct classes of applications to test their technique. The thumb interacts in an indirect manner whereas the pen is direct input. The actions of the thumb define how the actions of the pen are interpreted. These can also change one or more of the parameters of the pens action.
TriTap, by Gil, Lee, Im and Oakley, is a novel text input interaction technique for smartwatches, where the user can do different things with different fingers. They state, that angel and profile of the different fingers differ significantly because position of the two hands, when interacting with a smartwatch, is relatively static. At the end of their paper they describe how they conducted two experiments with keyboards designed for two or three finger input to explore the viability of their idea. 
Yeo, Phang, Castelucci and Kristensson developed a single-handed text input interaction technique for large devices called Shape Writing in Motion (SWiM). Instead of drawing a gesture like with other shape writing techniques, the user interacts by tilting the device and tapping when a wordâ€™s over. This is useful if the other hand is not available. It seems easy to learn and users reached 32 words per minute after just 90 minutes of practicing.
