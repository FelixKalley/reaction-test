1. What does Hornbæk say about the relationship between self-reported and objectively measured task performance? 

Hornbæk and Law found no correlation between self-reported task performance from users and actual measured outcomes (P.36)


2. Describe advantages and limitations of research hypotheses.

Advantages: 
Hypotheses provide a better understanding, about what a reasearcher is doing by giving clarity and focus about the reasearched question. (P.14)
Hypotheses can be useful for researchers, if they think about the input earlier work adds to the experiment being designed. (P.14)
Hypotheses help to merge and use earlier findings to motivate and design an experiment. (P.14)
Hypotheses help to report an experiment. (P.14)
Hypotheses are grounded in theory. (P.15)

Limitations:
Too often people formulate the null hypothesis in a way that it will simply be discomforted. (P.15)
Interesting findings could be overseen because a researcher relies to much on theory. (P.16)
For some experiments it may not be possible or useful to create hypotheses. (P.16)
Hypotheses can lead to prejudices and preoccupation, if the research question is exploratory (P.13)


3. Is it acceptable to conduct user studies with media informatics students as participants instead of a broad sample of potential users? What are advantages and limitations? Name one topic for a user study where it would be problematic to have only media informatics students as participants. Name one counter-example.

Yes it is acceptable, because students are people like everyone else and in the end it may not even matter (P.27)
One has to be aware of the circumstances of an experiment though.
Advantages: Students often have stronger cognitive skills, have developed less strong attitudes, are more likely to follow authority. (P.27) 
Limitations: 
Mostly they are shaped by living in western, industrialized and democratic societies. (P.27) 
Additionally, if experiences of the subjects are congruent with the topic studied by the experiment, that can have a big impact the results of the study (P.26)

Problematic topic for study: Überblicksstudie zur Technikaffinität von Studenten der Uni Regensburg
Counter-example: Blickverhalten von Informatik-Studenten beim Lesen von Programmiercode
